Intro to SQL
SQL is not space sensitive like Python is
Strings are in single quotes. Important to note that double quotes do not work!
SELECT keyword is used to return a result set of records, called a result-set, it limits the variables accessed to the ones listed
  -Syntax: SELECT var, var from database
  -selected variable can be modified in the declaration by operations even with other variables
WHERE keyword is used to filter results only to a those listed
  - Syntax: WHERE conditional
  - without using WHERE and only using SELECT, it will list out all of the database
  - WHERE can be used with conditionals to limit the database to desired premises

IN keyword is used to check if an item is an list (much like the Python IN check)
  -Syntax: var IN (data types)

examples:

SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

from a database called world, the variables name and population are accessed.
using the keyword WHERE tells us the variable that is checking for, population can be checked if WHERE is called on population

BETWEEN keyword allows ranges to searched and returns a result set
  -Syntax: BETWEEN(num1,num2)
LIKE keyword allows to search for strings, ints that are in a variable
  -Syntax: LIKE '%SEARCH%'
  -% in front means that it is at the end
  -% after means that it is in front
  -% in front and after means that it is anywhere
  -

example of LIKE:
  SELECT name from world
  WHERE name like '%EA%'

same usage of and/or, <, >, =
NOT keyword is used to do the opposite of a conditional much like Python

ROUND rounds a number to a certain amount of decimals:
  -Syntax: ROUND(float, int) where first float is the number being rounded and the int is how many decimals places
